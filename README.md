ðŸ“Œ **Notes**
- All solutions are written in C++.
- Folder names reflect difficulty (for Codeforces/Leetcode) or topic (for CSES).
- Filenames are usually based on the problem title or number for easy lookup.
- I aim to add clean, readable, and well-commented code wherever possible.

ðŸš€ **Goal**
Track consistent problem solving, improve speed and accuracy in contests, and build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms.
